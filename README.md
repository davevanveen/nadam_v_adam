# Nadam v. Adam
Comparison of Nadam and Adam optimization algorithms using example problems: (1) linear regression, (2) MNIST classification with logistic regression, and (3) MNIST classification with convolutional neural networks.

Each of the following files compare Adam and Nadam in a different setting:
1) linear_regression.ipynb
2) logistic_regression.ipynb
3) conv_nn.ipynb

More information on these algorithms can be found at:
